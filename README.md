#One-Click-Django Docs

## Docs Overview


The one-click-django scripts goal is to build as simply as possible a django enviroment: single server, single site development environment, for one developer.     
If you are new to django, this deployment can save you a lot of hussle, and yet let you develop and deploy to a full real website ASAP. 

After you read the one-click-django [Server ReadeMe](https://github.com/aviah/one-click-django-server/master/readme.md) and the dev ReadMe for [OSX](https://github.com/aviah/one-click-django-dev-osx-el-capitan/master/readme.md), or [Ubuntu 14.04](https://github.com/aviah/one-click-django-dev-ubuntu-14-04-trusty/master/readme.md), and then you can use these additional docs.

**Playground**: The [Playground](playground.md) let's you play and experiment a bit with the one-click-django project, both development machine and the server.

**Tutorial**: If you are new to django, continue with the one-click polls tutorial. The Tutorial implements the django opfficial tutorial, to the one-click-django project, with git, and real deployment! Start with [Part 1: Create the Polls App](tutorial_part1.md)

**Reference**: Quick reference with [Coding Refence](coding_ref.md), [Deployment](deployment.md), and [Command Line Aliases Reference](command_line_aliases_ref.md) about how to use the project. The [Project Reference](project_ref.md) provides a few more details   

**Advanced**: [What's Next](what_next.md) and [Multiple Site](multiple_sites.md) are useful when you want to move to the next steps, more developers, more sites, https, multiple servers, CDN etc

And of course, the [django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/) covers the enourmously feature rich django framework, and all the options it suggests. The django docs, which go above and beyond, are awesome.
